// Purpose:      A stack is a structure where item can be added and
//               removed from the top. Like a stack of plates  in a
//               kitchen. The   last entered item  will be   be the
//               first  removed. This  is  called  a  LIFO (last In First Out).
//               Inherits BaseList, adding the data item to each node.
